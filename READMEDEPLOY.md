  // this is generally to redirect the website to the index.php of the public folder which will do the necessary to do the routing of the routes in symfony

- connect to SSH using terminus /git bash
  and go to file public_html and launch
  php -r "copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer', 'composer-setup.php');"
  php -r "if (hash_file('sha384', 'composer-setup.php') === 'dac665fdc30fdd8ec78b38b9800061b4150413ff2e3b6f88543c636f7cd84f6db9189d43a81e5503cda447da73c7e5b6') { echo 'Installer verified'; } else { echo 'Installer corrupt'; unlink('composer-setup.php'); } echo PHP_EOL;"
  php composer-setup.php
  php -r "unlink('composer-setup.php');"

- php bin/console cache:clear --env=dev
  cleared the cache as the website was always in dev mode for the moment

-added this code to display the error at the PHP level which was not visible earlier with the incapatibility of the php versions
php_value display_errors 1
php_value display_startup_errors 1

- with the code above i got to know that i didnt do the do the installation of it dependencies which en error of the autoloading when i went to the site hall4all.fr( vendor was missing)

- installation of all the dependencies via git bash ( connecting using ssh)
  php composer.phar install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader

- but with the commande above i used to have a problem of the debug_bunddle so i change the .env file with app_env= prod

Bingo the website worked but the images of the logo was not visible yet at this point

-To be able to see the images the img folder should be inside the public folder not in assets so i just moved the img folder to the public and it worked

MAILER_DSN

- the contact page of the website was not working as there was no smtp de mail
  so i have added my mailtrap.io accounts smtp to be able to access the contact page
